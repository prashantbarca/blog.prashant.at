**Insulting wrong passwords**
I added 'Defaults insults' to the /etc/sudoers file.

Every time a sudoer enters the wrong password - Very interesting results

- Your mind just hasn't been the same since the electro-shock, has it?
- Listen, burrito brains, I don't have time to listen to this trash.
- That's something I cannot allow to happen.
- You silly, twisted boy you.
- I don't wish to know that.
